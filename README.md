## Election Audit Summary
#### This script can be used to calculate and process the breakdown of any election on any scale in one quick step. The only thing that would needed to be edited before running the program is where the excel file can be loaded. Once this is done and we have run the program, you can get the results of the election which include total votes, largest county, percent of votes for each candidate, winning candidate, and more. It can be used for state elections to calculate which candidate won and divide the votes by county or it can even be used for school elections to calculate who won and can be broken down by grade level.
